        <p>In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers and objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands,
            and the Goblet of Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, other characters decide Harry’s future for him,
            depriving him of freedom and choice. For example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’s
            life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding of his identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry
            Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and
            Hermione’s letters during the summer; by sealing the barrier to Platform 93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the
            Hogwarts Express; and by sending a Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking his wrist. Yet again,
            in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults intercede while attempting to protect Harry from
            perceived danger, as Snape observes: “Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep
            famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black” (284). All these characters, as enactors of fate, unknowingly
            drive Harry toward his destiny by attempting to control or to direct his life, while themselves controlled
            and directed by fate.</p>
